If you are reading this then it means you have had success reaching my repository.  

The key to the this project, I believe, is not the code and so much what we do with it, but that we are able to use GitHub (or whatever other Source Control software we had decided to use). 

I grabbed a simple C++ code that just asks for your name and then the computer outputs it by saying Hello Johnny, or whatever.

Hopefully you guys know some C++.  I would suggest we each add some lines of code just simply asking other questions and then having it output as well.

Then we just need some screen shots of us all working on it and each write a 1 page paper on the process and what we did, and that's what we turn in.

Let me know if you have any issues, thanks,
